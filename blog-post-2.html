                <p class="blog-text">
                    In today's digital battlefield, the war for bookings is fought on review sites. Potential guests are bombarded with choices, and their decisions are heavily influenced by online reviews. A single negative review can cost you bookings, damage your brand, and bleed your profits dry. But there's a better way. At Genreve, we're not about playing defense, we're about launching an all-out assault on negativity and building an online reputation that converts lookers into loyal guests.

                <h2 class="blog-section-title">The OTA Trap: Why Reputation Matters More Than Ever</h2>
                <p class="blog-text">
                    The OTAs control the playing field, charging hefty commissions and dictating the terms of engagement. But you have one weapon they can't control: your reputation. A strong online reputation is the ultimate conversion tool, driving direct bookings, lowering acquisition costs, and boosting your bottom line.
